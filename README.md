# Python-Test
A Python technical test

#### Create a Python2 program that:

1. download a big text file from a given URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yoeo/Python-Test/master/userdata.segment
2. split the downloaded file content into different files of 10 000 lines maximum each

#### What we expect:

1. a Python code that is easily understandable, it should produce the expected results
3. a text file explaining how the code works and why you implemented it that way, keep it short if possible

#### Bonus:

1. your coding styles will be mostly compatible with PEP8 https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
2. writing unit test is a plus
